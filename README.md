## Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course

1) a tidy data set as described below,
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work
   that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts.
